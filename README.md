# Guess-the-Number
Guess the Number game I created in the Godot Game Engine
# Why create Guess the Number game in Godot? 
It is a great first game to learn how to code and/or learn a new game engine.
Coding this game allows the developer to learn many programming concepts, and provides a sense of accomplishment in creating a game
with this short program. Whether coding a game for the first time or interested in learning the Godot Game Engine, 
Guess the Number is a good game to start with.
# What can users do with it?
Anyone can download it and learn with the project if he/she has the Godot Game Engine. 
# Where can users get help with it?
Email me at shadowolfphoenix@gmail.com. I'll be happy to help. If I need to, I will make a step by step tutorial. 
# How did you learn how to make Guess the Number in Godot?
I read the book Invent Your Own Computer Games with Python by Al Sweigart, which includes a chapter on creating Guess the Number game.
I also watched Awesome Tuts' YouTube series on creating Guess the Number in Unity. 
I broke down the game made in both Python and Unity to understand the way I must think to make this game. 
I took that way of thinking and made it in Godot.
